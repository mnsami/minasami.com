## About Me

Hello, I'm Mina, a seasoned software engineer with a passion for creating innovative and efficient solutions. With over 16 years of experience in the ever-evolving world of software development.

My journey in software engineering has taken me through various technologies and domains. I'm a PHP expert, well-versed in Symfony, Laravel, and the powerful Doctrine ORM. Over 16 years, I've crafted numerous RESTful APIs, catering to both internal and customer-facing needs.

But I don't stop at PHP. I've ventured into the Node.js landscape, where I've mastered Nest.js and mirko-ORM. Databases like MySQL and Postgres are familiar territories for me, and I navigate them with ease.

In today's tech world, cloud technologies are essential. I have an intermediate level of expertise with AWS and cloud technologies, making me a well-rounded engineer. I'm not just a developer, but a DevOps enthusiast. I'm proficient in CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab Runners, and I'm comfortable creating and building multi-stage Docker builds for various purposes.

While my primary focus is on backend development, I'm not limited to it. I also have experience with front-end technologies, including React.js, Vue.js, and UI frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap. Understanding both backend and frontend helps me create holistic solutions.

In my work, I embrace the Agile Scrum methodology and believe in the power of active communication within a team. I'm a firm advocate for pragmatic solutions, but I also prioritize code quality and maintainability to ensure long-term success.

As I embark on this mentorship journey, I bring a wealth of experience, a deep passion for teaching, and an unwavering commitment to nurturing the next generation of software engineers. My approach to mentorship goes beyond knowledge transfer; it's about inspiring creativity, fostering a love for the craft, and empowering mentees to achieve excellence.

Whether you're seeking consulting services, exploring job opportunities, or interested in potential partnerships, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Let's collaborate and build a brighter future for the tech industry together. Contact me today, and let's embark on a journey of growth and innovation.
