<h1>About Me</h1>

<div class="about-me">
    <p>
        I'm Mina, I'm a professional software engineer - since 2007 - with strong focus on back-end development and architecture. I'm very passionate about open source, product development and contributing to building solutions to the problems of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beside technological and architectural tools, I'm big fan of the Agile Scrum methodologies and I really like to discuss related topics and exchange experiences with other people in that business.
    </p>
    <p>
        Born and raised in Egypt, and moved to the Netherlands in 2013 and living there since then. Currently, I live in Haarlem, with my wife who is, also, a software engineer focused on front-end development, ironic, right?

        Coming from a very food oriented culture, I'm a foodie, like to cook, experiment, make adaptation to recipes from all around the world, my favorite chefs are: <a href="http://jamieoliver.com/" alt="http://jamieoliver.com/" target="_blank">Jamie Oliver</a>, <a href="http://nigella.com/" alt="http://nigella.com/" target="_blank">Nigella Lawson</a>, <a href="https://www.gordonramsay.com/" alt="https://www.gordonramsay.com/" target="_blank">Gordon Ramsay</a>, <a href="https://giadzy.com/" alt="https://giadzy.com/" target="_blank">Giada De Laurentiis</a> and <a href="http://www.barefootcontessa.com/" alt="http://www.barefootcontessa.com/" target="_blank">Ina Garten</a>
    </p>
    <p>
         Also, I am an old PC gamer, I played all Max Payne, Metal Gear Solid on PC. After buying PS4 in 2018, because of Spider-Man PS4 release, I have returned to the gaming arena.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used to blog in the past, and stopped very long time ago, but I'm here now with a new blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        So in this blog, I want to share my knowledge and experience, because sharing is caring, in my life journey about software development, architecture, code, infrastructure and Scrum.
    </p>
    <p>
        But, you may find, also, some favorite recipes, PS4 games reviews, hardware reviews as well, or at least this is what I'm intending to try and write about !
    </p>
    <p>
        And now, I hope you enjoy the journey of blogging with me, hoping to present to you valuable and enjoyable content.
    </p>
    <p>Cheers!</p>
