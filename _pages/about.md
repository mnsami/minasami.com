# About Me - Software Engineer & Mentor

Hello, I'm **Mina Nabil Sami**, a seasoned software engineer with a passion for creating innovative and efficient solutions. With over 16 years of experience in the ever-evolving world of software development.

## My Technical Expertise

My journey in software engineering has taken me through various technologies and domains. I'm a PHP expert, well-versed in Symfony, Laravel, and the powerful Doctrine ORM. Over 16 years, I've crafted numerous RESTful APIs, catering to both internal and customer-facing needs.

But I don't stop at PHP. I've ventured into the Node.js landscape, where I've mastered Nest.js and mirko-ORM. Databases like MySQL and Postgres are familiar territories for me, and I navigate them with ease.

In today's tech world, cloud technologies are essential. I have an intermediate level of expertise with AWS and cloud technologies, making me a well-rounded engineer. I'm not just a developer, but a DevOps enthusiast. I'm proficient in CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab Runners, and I'm comfortable creating and building multi-stage Docker builds for various purposes.

While my primary focus is on backend development, I'm not limited to it. I also have experience with front-end technologies, including React.js, Vue.js, and UI frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap. Understanding both backend and frontend helps me create holistic solutions.
