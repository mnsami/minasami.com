description: As part of my work, I need to build backend services and attach it to frontend, and for this I use docker containers `docker-compose` to make life easier during development. But I have always faced some problems with that approach, specially with UI frameworks like ReactJs which uses hotloading during development phase. Previously, I have not been doing it correctly, I was just building the API in a container, then I run `npm start` locally to run the development server and connect to the backend api and have a headacheless development time. But, finally I have had come to have the time and effort to research and come to the most optimized way to have a better development dockerized environment.
